## Quick Start

Ready to get started? Choose your preferred method:

### üè† Local Development
For developers who want to run Dashy.NET locally or contribute to the project.
[‚Üí Go to Installation Guide](/docs/installation)

### üê≥ Docker Deployment
The easiest way to get Dashy.NET running in production.
[‚Üí Go to Docker Guide](/docs/docker)

### Kubernetes
No offical documentation is planned for Dashy.NET. However you can use the official M$ documentation to guide you in the right direction;
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/deployment/overview#deploy-to-kubernetes

## IAC Options

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Azure Developer CLI
AZD provides a really simple way to deploy aspire applications to azure. It generates the bicep code based on ``Dashy.NET.AppHost``
For guide on how to install the azd cli go to the offical M$ docs(covers Windows, Linux and Mac): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows

For AZD we have 3 options in total where as 1 will be fully documented and the other two will mainly refer to the offical documentation.

#### Deploy Dashy.NET to azure with AZD (Option 1):
1. Clone the repo (``git clone https://github.com/Zalmez/Dashy.NET.git`` or ``gh repo clone Zalmez/Dashy.NET``) 
2. Navigate to the AppHost project folder: ``cd .\Dashy.Net.AppHost\``
3. Run the following command: ``dotnet run --project Dashy.Net.AppHost.csproj --output-path manifest.json --publisher manifest`` This builds the manifest AZD will basing the deployment of.
4. Initalize the azd env: ``azd init`` the cli will ask you to name your environment. Take note that this will be the prefix of any resources created with azd
5. Followed by ``azd up`` (‚ö†Ô∏èNOTE:‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you have signed in with an azure/entra id account that has contributor or owner access on a subscription as you will be prompted to select a subscription where the resources will be deployed)

#### Deploy using github actions (Option 2)
You can also fork the repo and have Dashy.NET be deployed with github actions. Please refer to the [offical documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/pipeline-github-actions) on how you can do that

#### Deploy using bicep generated by AZD (Option 3):
1. Clone the repo (``git clone https://github.com/Zalmez/Dashy.NET.git`` or ``gh repo clone Zalmez/Dashy.NET``) 
2. Navigate to the AppHost project folder: ``cd .\Dashy.Net.AppHost\``
3. Run the following command: ``dotnet run --project Dashy.Net.AppHost.csproj --output-path manifest.json --publisher manifest`` This builds the manifest AZD will basing the deployment of.
4. Generate the bicep code by running ``azd infra gen``
