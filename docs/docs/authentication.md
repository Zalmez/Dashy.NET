# Authentication

Authentication documentation is coming soon.

This page will cover:

- Setting up authentication providers
- Configuring OAuth/OpenID Connect
- Managing user permissions
- Security best practices

## Coming Soon

This documentation is currently being prepared. Check back soon for detailed authentication setup guides.

For now, Dashy.NET runs without authentication by default, allowing full access to all features.
